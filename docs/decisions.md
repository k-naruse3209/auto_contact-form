# Decisions

## 2026-01-07
- Expanded Phase4 field keyword matching to cover "名前/onamae" and "mailadd" and deprioritize email confirmation fields.
- Allowed Phase4 contact overrides to use a different domain when explicitly configured.
- Narrowed Phase4 missing-required checks to name/email/message to avoid false positives when no company field exists.
- Added optional Phase4 company allowlist support for targeted reruns.
- Added a default Phase1 query that appends "コンサル会社" to the company name.
- Added Phase1 query variants for "会社情報" and penalized portfolio/case-study pages in official URL scoring.
- Added Phase1 penalties for known portal domains and entries that lack the company name in title/snippet/display.
- Boosted Phase1 scoring when the legal name (株式会社/有限会社 + 社名) appears in title/snippet/display and added kensetumap.com to negative domains.
- Tightened legal-name matching to the exact "株式会社/有限会社 + 社名" string and added job/member portal domains to the negative list.
- Added consulting keyword boosts and non-consulting keyword penalties in Phase1 scoring to avoid mismatched industries.
- Added non-official keyword penalties and skipped negative-domain candidates when choosing the official URL.
- Added dashboard actions to open forms and copy a fill script for manual execution in the form tab.
- Set Phase4 company field to always use sender company (DXAI) instead of target company name.
- Added Phase4 mapping for split first/last name fields to populate 成瀬/恵介 separately when available.
- Limited split-name mapping to explicit 姓/名 labels (or first/last equivalents) to avoid mis-filling generic name fields.
